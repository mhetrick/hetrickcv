### Gate Junction
This is an eight-channel gate manipulator that was designed to work quickly with the Analog to Digital, Digital to Analog, and Rotator modules. This takes in up to eight gate signals. Each gate can be muted and/or inverted. The inversion behavior does not turn a positive gate negative. Rather, a positive gate will be changed to 0V, while a 0V signal will be changed to +5V. In more technical terms, it is a logic inverter. As an added convenience, the inputs are normalled together. If a cable is not plugged into an input, it will receive the value of the input above it.
