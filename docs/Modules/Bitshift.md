### Bitshift
This is a harsh waveshaping effect. It is particularly useful for taking a slow, smooth CV value and creating a lot of rapid discontinuities. The effect is produced by taking the internal floating-point representation of the signal and turning it into a 32-bit integer. The integer's bits are then shifted left (<<, which produces aggressive alterations to the signal) or right (>>, which is mostly just attenuation). Because the algorithm for this module has expected boundaries, you will need to select a range for the input signal. +/- 5V is the standard range for most audio generators in Rack. Some function generators will produce +/- 10V, though. Regardless, since this is a fairly harsh and experimental module, there's no need to select the "correct" range...
