This is a list of ongoing ideas and plans for existing modules. If you would like to contribute to the project, feel free to open a pull request!

## General
- Go over all polyphonic modules and see what can be SIMD-optimized.
- Rewrite library functions using templates to allow easier SIMD optimization.
- Replace usage of the global Gamma Domain with individual Domains for each module.
- Add useful right-click options to the various sequencers, such as Randomize Gates Only, Rotate Sequence Left/Right, etc.
- More tutorials!
